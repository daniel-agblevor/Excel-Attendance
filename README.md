## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 🔧 **Workbook Setup & Formatting**

* Clean, consistent headers: `Name`, `Month`, `Contact`, `Group/Department`, `Total Days Present`, `Actual Days Present`, etc.
* Use of **Copilot** and **custom cell styles** for consistent formatting (font size, bold headers, background color).
* Workbook saved as both a working file and a reusable **template**.

### 🧮 **Formulas and Data Management**

* **VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP** used to:

  * Retrieve contact info from `List1_ContactInfo`.
  * Map departments/groups from `List2_Department`.
* **SUMIF** applied in `Actual Days Present` to count presence from `List3_Details`.

### 🎨 **Conditional Formatting**

* "Attendance Status" column colored by status:

  * **Green** for "Present"
  * **Red** for "Absent"
* "Actual Days Present" uses **data bars** for intuitive visualization.
* Distinctive color highlights for each **department group**.

### 📊 **Data Visualization**

* PivotTables answer key questions:

  * 📅 Which day had the highest/lowest attendance?
  * 👥 Who attended most or only once?
  * 📈 Attendance rates per group and individual.
* Charts included to:

  * Visualize total attendees per day.
  * Analyze departmental attendance rates.

### 📐 **Attendance Compliance Logic**

* Attendance % = `Actual Days Present / Total Days Present`.
* Compliance rules:

  * Groups A, B, C: ✅ ≥ 80%
  * Groups D, E: ✅ ≥ 40%
* Column “Attendance Requirement Met” evaluates each person against criteria.

## 🧪 Functionality Tests
